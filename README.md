# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Classification!
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a condition that occurs when high blood sugar levels damage the retina, the light-sensitive tissue in the back of the eye. It's a leading cause of blindness in working-age adults and a leading cause of vision loss worldwide. 
Symptoms of DR include: Blurred vision, Seeing spots or floaters, A dark or empty spot in the center of your vision, and Difficulty seeing well at night. 
DR can be detected during an eye exam, which may include dilating your pupils to look for changes in your blood vessels. Your doctor may also perform a fluorescein angiogram to check for leaking or damaged blood vessels
